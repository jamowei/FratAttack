# Intro

_FratAttack_ is a drinking board-game with two goals:

* Save your fraternity from the evil mind-controlling aliens that have invaded during last-nights party.
* Getting hammered in the process.

Luckily, the aliens mind-control does not work on people under the influence. Now that you think about it, that's probably why they attacked the fraternities first. Once they fall, who could stand in their way to world [domination] [1]. It's your task to defeat the aliens before the other players (because, glory).

The gameplay itself is pretty easy. Think of _FratAttack_ as a paper version of party games such as Mario Party, which also happens to include drinking a lot.

#Download
This game is completely free, and you can print it out yourself. You can [download](https://github.com/Qgel/FratAttack/releases) a PDF version that is kept up-to-date as the game evolves.

# What You'll Need

To play this game, you will need:

* The printed out materials of the game (board, cards and scoring cards)
* A die and some figures that represent the players on the board. Bottle caps work well!
* A drink to sip, e.g. Beer
* Spirits and shot glasses
* 3 or more people

# Contributing

_FratAttack_ is playable, but there are still lot's of things we'd like to improve!
If you'd like to help, there are several ways:

* If you have an idea for a card that you think would fun, let us know!
* Let us know about mistakes (spelling, unclear rules,...)
* Nothing is written in stone. Got a cool flavor text or name for a card that already has one? If we like it, we might change it.
* Art. I'm terrible at designing the graphics that can make a game so much better. If you want to contribute designs for cards, board, etc you are more than welcome!

The easiest way to let us know about your ideas is to open an issue on the bugtracker!
